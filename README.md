# VCS - A framework for oversimplifying code
Welcome to the VCS Github, VCS is a tiny framework, library or whatever you you call it
that oversimplifies code in python!

## Example program in VCS:

import main as VCS\
VCS.charout(detectPlatform())

## There's documentation in the file itself also, so no need to do it here.
